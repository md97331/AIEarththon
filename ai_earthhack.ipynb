In the EU, car sharing is considered a classic example of the Circular Economy (\"\"Circular Green\"\") and undeniably has many advantages but also serious disadvantages. One disadvantage is the search for a parking space, which in Berlin is strongly dependent on the respective district. The further you drive into the city, the more difficult it is to find a parking space. One problem is that the rental process can only be completed once the vehicle has been appropriately parked. Only then can someone take over the car and start their journey. This sometimes leads to significantly extended driving distances because the parking spaces can sometimes be very far away, or you must drive around the block many times. This increases not only the costs but also the fuel consumption and the frustration level because this problem could deter especially occasional users.\n",

Electric-arc furnace technology produces a significant amount of dust during steel production, estimated to be 15-20 kg per tonne of the total steel produced. Because it contains heavy metals such as iron, copper, zinc, Cobalt, Cadmium, or Lead, it has been classified as a hazardous material and non-disposable in the environment by the European Waste Catalogue (EWC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Brazilian National Standards Organization (ABNT). The Disposal of EAFD in landfills represented an environmental hazard due to its dusty nature and the presence of potentially toxic metals and the cost of disposal is not negligible in the United States, for example, it costs 200 million dollars per year to dispose of EAFD.\n",

Upskilling remains the biggest challenge for those currently in-role; however, most training material lacks contextual relevance and practicality. The sustainability workforce finds it difficult to identify snackable and interactive courses tied to real-world needs. This forces employees to learn on-the-job, sift through piles of reports and white papers trying to figure out how to apply learnings in real life, and hoping to get approval to attend conferences. This takes time, creates inefficiencies, introduces risk, creates friction, and stalls progress. To achieve the SDGs by 2030, corporate-wide adoption of sustainability practices is required. If those currently in sustainability roles have friction, the upskilling challenge sets nonexperts up for failure. The slow pathway to sustainability is correlated with the need for inclusive upskilling. Experts agreeÉhuman capital development is urgently needed, and it must start now within all companies, industries, and roles. Billions of people require upskilling, and Skills Hustle is here to solve the sustainability upskilling problem.\n",

Additionally, traditional construction practices often result in buildings and structures that are designed for a single use and have a limited lifespan, leading to the frequent demolition and replacement of buildings.
